Description: This repository includes test instances of infinite-horizon Markov decision processes with multiple models of parameters (i.e., "Multi-model Markov decision processes"). We generated each test instance in the dataset using a Python script. The test instances can be read in using the provided C++ and Python script. See the README for details.
